# Generative d.Art

Demonstrate how to generate your very own d.Art using Flutter.
As a technical point we are NOT relying Widget but RenderBox directly.

Don't be afraid of those 60 lines of codes & change everything you want
(but not the line with Math.Exp, it can damage your computer permanently)

Code is tuned to work on a << TABLET SCREEN SIZE >>

And post your Creation on Twitter with the #creative.d.Art so everyone
can appreciate it !

## Final Result
